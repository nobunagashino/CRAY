DtCyber install (Ubuntu 24.04.1)
git clone https://github.com/kej715/DtCyber.git
sudo apt install gcc perl make
sudo apt install xfonts*
<reboot server>
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install libx11-dev

in DtCyber 
cp Makefile.linux64 Makefile
make
cd ../automation
make
cd ../NOS2.8.7
sudo node install

NB. This makes a basic system but does not seem to have the web interfaces enabled-need to investigate:you can still use 
telnet localhost
to access the system. At this point shut the simulator down as we will set up the cray and the simulators work best if you start the cray first (making sure the class normal is on and limits are 6) and then start the Cyber.


Cray install
sudo apt install g++ make libboost-all-dev libncurses-dev libgpm-dev xterm telnet
sudo apt lua5.4 bison flex
We are going to make the simulator along with examples so we need to
download and install COS-tools first
git clone https://github.com/kej715/COS-Tools.git
cd COS-Tools
make
su root
make install
and then a cross-compiler 
https://github.com/kej715/ack.git
cd ack
./cray-build.sh
su root
./cray-build.sh install
These two packages are updated quite regularly and could be useful-so worth
keeping an eye on..The ack package provides a number of cross-compliers for 
basic,c and,god forbid pascal(*) for use on the cray.
git clone https://github.com/andrastantos/cray-sim.git
cd cray-sim
cd simulator
make
cd ../target
cd cos_117
./build_boot_tape
./build_exp_disk_with_examples

Now we need to start the Cray,install COS_117 and bring it up so it can run jobs.
cd ../..
./run
one CPU box will appear along with three IOP xterms.
in IOP0 type
START COS_117 INSTALL   
(note normally you would type START COS_117 DEADSTART)
After a bit you should see "START COMPLETE"
type
STATION
which opens a CRAY STATION Session
type 
LOGON
STMSG
REPLY,0,GO
The Console will say a start install,go to continue
REPLY,1,GO
you will see disk activity in the Peripherals box
STMSG,INFO
Will Show you details..
press the + key on keypad and it should show "STARTUP COMPLETE"
CONSOLE,1
CONSOLE,2
(which suprise suprise opens two more STATION console sessions)
in CONSOLE,1 type
STATCLASS
You Should see the normal class is  off,and max JXTS(Limit) is 0
CLASS,NORMAL,ON
LIMIT,6
And the class settings and limit will change 
now type 
STATUS
This will show datasets being processes so worth keeping an eye on
in CONSOLE,2
type 
LINK
This shows connections and there should be one called AP

Time to fire up the Dtcyber...
First copy over your site.cfg file to
DtCyber/NOS2.8.7
mine looks like
[NETWORK]
crayStation=XMP1,XMP,24,127.0.0.1:9000,SFE,CC1
and then start the DtCyber
sudo node start
When the system is deadstarted and you have the operator prompt type
reconfigure
This can take some time so grab a coffee..
It will probably fail the first time-simply restart and rerun the configure 
command and it should go though the second time..
So grab a second coffee...
So hopefully you should be looking at a green screen..Line 25 should read something
like
25  CRS  X 72 402 X CRAY COS1.17 02/28.89 120
and the CRAY LINK Console should have a new line 
FE 0 0 0 8 8 16  1 3600 1,4

Great-the two emulators can now talk to each other..
We can have some fun by running an interactive session from the DtCyber
telnet localhost
login as GUEST
/HELLO,ICF
/LOGON
!ACCOUNT,AC=CRAY.
!FETCH,DN=HELLOA,MF=AP,AC=ST,TEXT=BIN/HELLOA.
SS004 - DATASET RECEIVED FROM FRONT END
!HELLOA.
Hello world!
! /BYE
BYE
ICF002 - LOGOFF,TID=GUEST  ,JN=GUEST   ,PN= 1.    
ICF006 - GOODBYE FROM ICF.           
ICF     CONNECT TIME 00.04.35.
TE02P04 - APPLICATION: 
      
JSN: AACP, NAMIAF

We can now run the cos-tools tape

10:55:20 [DtCyber Console] Operator> install -f cos-tools
10:55:33 AM ----------------------------------
10:55:33 AM Starting installation of cos-tools
10:55:33 AM Download tape image ...
10:55:34 AM Mount tape ...                            
10:55:42 AM Run job opt/cos-tools.job ...
10:58:46 AM Run cos-tools POST-install tasks ...
10:58:46 AM   Run job opt/cos-tools-proclib.job ...
10:58:58 AM   Run job opt/cos-tools-utils.job ...
10:59:04 AM   Run job opt/cos-tools-lisp.job ...
10:59:56 AM   Run command "node opt/cos-tools.post" ...
11:00:31 AM   Run job opt/cos-tools-cleanup.job ...
11:00:39 AM cos-tools installed successfully
 
As the tape runs keep an eye on the STATUS console and you will see
datasets moving in and out of the cray..
Takes a few mintues to run..

Stuff still to do
Get the web interfaces up and working
Get a PLATO console up and working

Things I want to do
Write an interactive mode program (pref in C) for the Cray.

(*) Just joking..I learnt programming using Pascal.
